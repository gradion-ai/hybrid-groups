### Unit Tests

- `invoke ut --cov` for running unit tests and generating a coverage report.

### Integration Tests
- `invoke it` for running all integration tests.
- `invoke it --cov` for running all integration tests and generating a coverage report.
- `pytest -xsv tests/integration/test_[name].py` for running a single integration test file.
- `pytest -xsv tests/integration/test_[name].py::[test-name]` for running a single integration test.
